// Due to the size of this program I have decided to splt it up into multiple files. To compile without any
// errors, you must compile it along with the file 'RBT.cpp'. That file contains all of the functions that will
// be referenced to perform operations on the Red and Black Tree. Due to the use of nullptr, the program also requires
// that you compile it using at least c++11. The command I used to compile was as follow:

// ++ -std=c++11  hw7.cpp RBT.cpp -o hw7
// ./hw7

// A redâ€“black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree in computer science. 
// Each node of the binary tree has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the color 
// (red or black) of the node. These color bits are used to ensure the tree remains approximately 
// balanced during insertions and deletions. Most operations on a Red Black Tree can be completed in
// O(log n)
